# Parsing

One of the important tasks in natural language processing include parsing sentences. This project provides Earley's implementation of Parsing using predict, scan/attach and complete phases. There are two implementations available, one without any parsing tricks which is therefore slower and the other one with parsing tricks which speeds up parsing however it may be slightly error prone.

Usage:

Without parsing tricks,
python3 parse.py

With parsing tricks,
python3 parse2.py
